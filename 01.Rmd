# My first cool idea: Food for thought - Waste Not, Want Not

#### Keywords {-}

ioT, food wastage, donation, recipe

## Problem

1. Are we using all the groceries we buy? Have you ever thrown food from Refrigerator or Pantry that are past the expiry date because you did not realize they were just sitting there? 
2. Have we ever thought about the effect of food wastage on environment? How do we reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from Landfills that process food wastage?
3. How can we help the millions suffering in hunger? Can we make a social impact by eliminating wastage and helping feed every living human with a minimum one meal a day?  

One answer resonates with all the questions above, ‘eliminate food wastage’. While the problem may sound as truism and stating the obvious, I believe Data Science can be used as a medium to help not just answer these questions but provide adaptable solutions.

According to Food and Agricultural Organization, over 1/3rd of food produced never get consumed every year and this wastage amounts to 1.3 billion tons of edible food that can feed about 1.6 billion people. This number attributes to 22% of the world’s population. 

And,it’s not just the food that is being wasted. The resources such as water, energy used in the production of food are being wasted as well.

## Solution

While it is evident that food is being wasted in all stages of a Food Supply cycle – Production, Distribution, Retail and Consumer usage, this idea is written with Consumers and Restaurants as the end-client in mind. 

#### Items expiring soon…
1.  Pantry image is scanned using 3D camera to digitally map the entire pantry, including shelves, height of shelves, depth and width. On the Pantry/Refrigerator door, install an iOT device to scan, register and watermark (through simple color coding / labels) an item. Data captured will include (Use by / Best By / Batch number etc / Weight / Nutrition information etc.) NOTE: A parallel MLT will scan  FDA and EEMA sites for safety and recall information to alert customer. 
2.  Items can be placed on the ioT shelf liner which will have a pressure sensor to measure weight, any delta in the data will signify usage of the item. 3D map technology and location data will give consumer freedom to place item anywhere within Pantry or refrigerator. 
3.  When an item nears expiry, it provides an alert 

#### Recipes you may want…
4.	 Using Machine learning technique, provide personalized suggestion of recipes taking into account ingredients available and about to expire, your cuisine preferences, allergies etc.

#### Items you may want to buy…
5.	 Generate smart shopping list for the items you’re running out so you can re-stock your inventory (what you need to buy, when you need to buy). We can extend this feature further and place orders to deliver groceries

#### Donations you may want to make…
6.  Create neural network for collection of food from consumers and restaurants to facilitate donation to food banks

7.  Compost food scrap – Promote organic farming by using Data to study yield of home gardens fed with homemade compost.

## Difference.

While we may have challenges such as limited data that is not comprehensive enough and changing human behavior pattern, this effort will Save Money, Save Environment and make a Social Impact by reducing hunger.
