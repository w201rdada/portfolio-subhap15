## Problem

1. Are we using all the groceries that we buy? Have you ever thrown food from Refrigerator or Pantry that are past the expiry date because you did not realize they were just sitting there? 
2. Have we ever thought about the effect of food wastage on the environment? How do we reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from the Landfills that process food wastage?
3. How can we help the millions suffering in hunger? Can we make a social impact by eliminating wastage and helping feed every living human with a minimum one meal a day?  

One answer resonates with all the questions above, ‘eliminate food wastage’. While the problem may sound as truism and stating the obvious, my App and Concept uses Data Science as a medium to help not just answer these questions but provide adaptable solutions.

According to Food and Agricultural Organization, over 1/3rd of food produced never get consumed every year and this wastage amounts to 1.3 billion tons of edible food that can feed about 1.6 billion people. This number attributes to 22% of the world’s population. 

And,it’s not just the food that is being wasted. The resources such as water, energy used in the production of food is being wasted as well.

## Solution

While food is being wasted in Production, Processing and Distribution, this idea looks to solve the food wastage issue at the consumer level which is the largest source of wastage and at the end of food chain.

-> Provide data to shop wisely at grocery stores

-> IoT: Pantry/Refrigerator – RFID – use of technology to track inventory of perishable and non-perishable food supply, including quantity and expiry dates

-> Use Data Science to generate recipes based on available ingredients 

-> Create neural network for collection of food from consumers using real time data

-> Collect, correlate and publish real time data to help consumers donate to food banks and hunger relief in time

-> Compost food scrap – Promote organic farming by using Data to study yield of home gardens fed with homemade compost.

## Difference.

While we may have challenges such as limited data that is not comprehensive enough and changing human behavior pattern, this effort will Save Money, Save Environment and make a Social Impact by reducing hunger.
