## Trouble starting a family? You're not alone...

To put the fertility process in perspective, two letters is all it takes to create life, ‘x’ and ‘y’... but wish life was that simple. Infertility is a global issue, even advancements in the field of medicine and science have not made a significant change in the last 10 years. CDC reports over 7.3 million women in US utilized infertility services between 2011 – 2015. (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/infertility.htm ).The US fertility treatment market is expected to be valued at USD 6 Billion and global market at USD 20 Billion by the end of 2020. US holds 1/3rd of the Global Market Share in the fertility treatment sector which may very well be tagged as an industry. Growing cost of fertility treatments not just take a toll on the patients financially, but also on their emotional well-being owing to the uncertainty of treatment outcome. Centers offering fertility treatments have little time, or the right resources to spend more time on diagnosis and preliminary treatment. They are not equipped well to give information on what else patients could try before spending on treatments such as alternate therapies including acupuncture, meditation, yoga and simple lifestyle changes that have shown tremendous results for some couples. Most fertility clinics have the patients start with an IUI and then proceed to an IVF. While IUI is far cheaper, IVF is quite expensive. For most patients their biological clock is ticking and they may not be a suitable candidate for IUI. Enter "Bloom"!

## What does Bloom offer?

A self-help tool for patients and treatment tool for providers which would:
a.	Explore all preliminary tests to be completed prior to starting fertility treatments
b.	Based on predictive models created from test results, provide comprehensible suggestions on the best course of treatments and their success rate

## Why Bloom?

Currently there are few software in  the market that offer simple dashboards that focus more on prediction of treatment outcome. While predicting the outcome is a great concept, it is still objective and hardly accounts for  emotional impact of negative results on the patients. It is easier for a patient to be convinced of the results (positive or negative) once they have tried all possible options and move on than go through the financial and emotional drain. 

With advancements in science and the field of fertility, there are various tests and preliminary treatments that can be performed before a patient chooses to go through fertility treatment. Bloom is not just an App but also a companion all through their journey in the treatment process. It will be designed to provide patients with a holistic view of:
•	Where they are currently?

•	What tests needs to be done prior to starting the treatment process?

•	What preliminary and supplemental treatment they could take before starting the treatment? 

•	What changes do they need to adopt in their lifestyle?

•	How the preliminary treatment or changes in lifestyle would benefit them? By what % does it increase the success ratio of the treatment process?

•	Access to peer support groups going through similar treatment process

•	Access to medical experts who will be available on-call (premium service) 

#### Data Collection:
The goal is to design an App which will collect extensive data from users, not limited to : Genetics, Age, Race, Ethnic origin, demographic information (where they were born, where they grew up, where they live now: this is a key piece of information which will help determine external factors such as climate, environment they may have been exposed to), occupation (which could present as one of the factors for physical and emotional stress). Besides the extensive Blood tests which tests a patient more for hormone imbalances, the discovery process will include genetic blood tests that may reveal Mutation of Genes (eg. MTHFR). Various parameters will be taken into consideration to understand the patient and their partner’s medical history, family history and fed into the software. An algorithm will then check to see if it has all the values required to feed the data to the next step. For any missing values, a custom test order will be generated to obtain further information. 

#### Discovery:
Once all values have been fed into the app, it will compare this data against patients with similar ethnicity, age group and their outcome to provide a preliminary report on the success rates with past data. A neural network of fertility centers across the country will help increase the data sample size. The system will start an auto-elimination process based on Machine Language Technique to compare various reasons that has caused infertility in the male or female.

#### Prediction:
The program will use data captured from the patient and compare it with available data from the Neural Network of World Wide Fertility Centers (NNWWFC) to build predictive models for outcome of various fertility treatments. AI bot will continue to analyze and perfect the predictive model as it continues to collect data (consent will be acquired) from Patients. 

#### Prescription:
Based on all computations, patients will be presented with a holistic picture on the possible conditions that may have caused infertility, procedure options and the success rate with each, a list of preliminary treatment options, alternative therapies and life style changes before undertaking the actual procedure. By this time the predictive model would have given the best possible options for them including data to support success rates or in some cases prepare them for the outcome which may not be favorable. 

While the field of medicine captures data pertaining to science behind the reasons of infertility in men or women, my app will have the ability to build models which includes non-medical data to identify few causes for infertility.

## Next steps
Besides being a software companion to the patients, Bloom can also help with comprehensive data to help make case with Insurance companies on behalf of the patients. Insurance companies hardly cover such fertility treatments but those which do cover, expect the patients complete few cycles of IUI before authorizing IVF. Data Analysis can help provide data to insurance companies with complete profile on what the success rates are and why there should be an exception made in the patient’s case. The same Data can also help selfpay patients to choose or skip few preliminary treatments before signing up for IVF.

The tool continues to collect data from patients who are undergoing treatments to keep perfecting its model for suggestive / customized treatments. Over a period of time, the tool would have matured to provide closest to accurate results in outcome of treatment, retention of pregnancy and a healthy baby.
