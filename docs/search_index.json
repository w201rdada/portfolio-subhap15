["Food-Wastage.html", "1 Food for thought - Waste Not, Want Not 1.1 Problem 1.2 Solution 1.3 Challenges and Next Steps", " 1 Food for thought - Waste Not, Want Not Keywords IoT, Smart Inventory, food wastage, recipe ideas, grocery list, donation, composting 1.1 Problem Are we using all the groceries we buy? Have you ever thrown food from Refrigerator or Pantry that are past the expiry date because you did not realize they were just sitting there? Have we ever thought about the effect of food wastage on environment? How do we reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from Landfills that process food wastage? How can we feed the millions suffering in hunger, and not the landfill? One answer resonates with all the questions above, ‘eliminate food wastage’. While the problem may sound as truism and stating the obvious, I believe Data Science can be used as a medium to help not just answer these questions but provide adaptable solutions. According to Food and Agricultural Organization, over 1/3rd of food produced never get consumed every year and this wastage amounts to 1.3 billion tons of edible food that can feed about 1.6 billion people. This number attributes to 22% of the world’s population. And, it’s not just the food that is being wasted. The resources such as water, energy used in the production of food are being wasted as well. (Candy 2017) Fig-1: What gets tossed more often? (Helmer 2018) 1.2 Solution While it is evident that food is being wasted in all stages of a Food Supply cycle – Production, Distribution, Retail and Consumer usage, this idea is written with Consumers as end-clients in mind (could be extended to Restaurants in future). Fig-2: Who is wasting the most food? My solution applies concepts of Data Science to create an inventory solution which alerts customers of: What is available in their refrigerator and Pantry? What is expiring in the near term? What is the current level / weight of items left in both Pantry and refrigerator? What are the locations of items in the pantry? What can I cook with the soon to be expiring items? What items am I running out of stock and what do I need to buy? Where can I drop off food I no longer need? Where are the nearest compost recycling sites? This solution comprises of the following ecosystem: IoT device - Integrating Raspberry PI or an Arduino with 3D enabled camera technology to perform Pantry 3D mapping. These devices are Wifi/bluetooth capability to enable communication with any Android or iOS device. The App: To be developed for both iOS and Android platform, besides Desktop versions. The App will have two different interfaces - one for individual users and another for restaurants. Here is what the solution offers: 1.2.0.1 Items expiring soon… Pantry images will be captured using a 3D camera to digitally map the entire pantry, including shelves, height of shelves, depth and width. On the Pantry/Refrigerator door, an iOT device needs to be installed to scan, register and watermark (through simple color coding / RFID labels) an item. As part of the solution, one of the functions of the IoT device is to generate an unique watermark or RFID labels which will be affixed on the container. It will only take a minute for the user to apply a custom label for food without RFID such as restaurant leftovers and answer a few questions on the app. (Type of food, approx. servings left etc). Data captured will include (Use by / Best By / Batch number etc / Weight / Nutrition information etc.) NOTE: In parallel, we can use Machine learning technique to scan FDA and EEMA sites for safety and recall information to alert customer. Items need to be placed on the IoT shelf liner which will have a pressure sensor to measure weight, any delta in the data will signify usage of the item. 3D map technology and location data will give consumer freedom to place item anywhere within Pantry or refrigerator. When an item nears expiry, an alert (push notification) will be provided to the end user (on their registered devices/emails) 1.2.0.2 Recipes you may want… Using Machine learning technique, the App will provide personalized suggestion of recipes to consumers taking into account ingredients available and about to expire, your cuisine preferences, allergies etc. 1.2.0.3 Items you may want to buy… This App will generate smart shopping list for the items you’re running out so you can re-stock your inventory (what you need to buy, when you need to buy). This feature can be extended further and orders can be placed to deliver groceries. 1.2.0.4 Donations you could make… Fig-3: Food Donation (Eat 2018) The next step in reducing food wastage is to recover excess food from consumers facilitating donation to food banks. The roadblocks to making donation are not knowing the location to drop-off food, transportation and liability concerns. This App will provide real-time data regarding where food is needed, quantity needed, when delivery can be made at the earliest etc. This tool will take over the logistics aspect of the connecting Demand (organizations willing to accept donation) with Supply (Consumers interested in donating) analyzing various parameters including but not limited to location (eg. within 10 miles), availability (food), max storage time (fresh/frozen), numbers of individuals needing donation, their allergy information, availability of delivery service (such as Uber Eats, Door Dash) and selecting the closest location matching the parameters. Consumers will be also able to communicate with non-profit food rescue teams(such as Second Servings Houston) using the app, in addition to accessing real-time information on locations accepting donations. To alleviate the concern over liability arising out of food donation, the App will have more information to educate consumers about federal laws such as Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act that provide liability protection to donors as long as they do not act with negligence or intentional misconduct. The App will also have a one click disclaimer for the organization receiving food donation protecting the donors interest. When we extend this product to Restaurants in future, the App can be used generate tax receipts for food donation so that donors can claim tax incentives for their business to deduct the cost to produce the food and half the difference between the cost and fair market value of the donated food. 1.2.0.5 Home Composting made easy… Compost food scrap – Promote organic farming among consumers by providing a predictive analytics tool to study yield of home gardens fed with homemade compost in the available space. Also, assist in locating the nearest compost recycling sites 1.2.0.6 How is this idea different from the ones already available in the market? While most products in the market focus on Refrigerator, there is good amount of food being stored and wasted in our pantries. Often consumers end up buying more of the same without realizing the current inventory in their pantry. In few cases an item could be opened and stowed away for future use and forgotten forever. Pantry mapping technology will give consumers the flexibility in storing and keeping track of items purchased and used. Currently, most of these technologies are only available for commercial purposes. Most of these technologies listed in the solution are currently available for commercial purposes (Smart Shelves) and few more currently in testing (3D Mapping of interior space). 1.3 Challenges and Next Steps While most technologies mentioned here are currently available for commercial purposes, there is still work that needs to be done to scale it down for consumer use. The impact of using RFID labels on safety of food is yet to be studied. As part of motivating people to use this App, we need to build targeted awareness (online) campaigns &amp; focus groups, partner with grocery chains to integrate their digital coupons with native app. In addition, with funding through partnership with consumer appliance manufacturers, these technologies can be made available to consumers. While we may also have challenges such as limited data that is not comprehensive enough and changing human behavior pattern, this effort will make a difference to Save Money, Save Environment and make a Social Impact by reducing hunger.

["Bloom.html", "2 Bloom - Predictive Analytics Tool for Fertility Treatment 2.1 Trouble starting a family? You’re not alone… 2.2 What does Bloom offer? 2.3 Why Bloom? 2.4 Next steps", " 2 Bloom - Predictive Analytics Tool for Fertility Treatment Keywords Predictive analytics, Fertility Treatment, Bio-informatics, Genomics 2.1 Trouble starting a family? You’re not alone… To put the fertility process in perspective, two letters is all it takes to create life, ‘x’ and ‘y’… but wish life was that simple. Infertility is a global issue, even advancements in the field of medicine and science have not made a significant change in the last 10 years. CDC reports over 7.3 million women in US utilized infertility services between 2011 – 2015. (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/infertility.htm ).The US fertility treatment market is expected to be valued at USD 6 Billion and global market at USD 20 Billion by the end of 2020. US holds 1/3rd of the Global Market Share in the fertility treatment sector which may very well be tagged as an industry. Growing cost of fertility treatments not just take a toll on the patients financially, but also on their emotional well-being owing to the uncertainty of treatment outcome. Centers offering fertility treatments have little time, or the right resources to spend more time on diagnosis and preliminary treatment. They are not equipped well to give information on what else patients could try before spending on treatments such as alternate therapies including acupuncture, meditation, yoga and simple lifestyle changes that have shown tremendous results for some couples. Most fertility clinics have the patients start with an IUI and then proceed to an IVF. While IUI is far cheaper, IVF is quite expensive. For most patients their biological clock is ticking and they may not be a suitable candidate for IUI. How can we help such patients? Enter “Bloom”! 2.2 What does Bloom offer? A self-help tool for patients and treatment tool for providers which would: Explore all preliminary tests to be completed prior to starting fertility treatments Based on predictive models created from test results, provide comprehensible suggestions on the best course of treatments and their success rate Fig-1: Fertility Treatment Options 2.3 Why Bloom? Currently there are few apps in the market that offer simple dashboards that focus more on prediction of treatment outcome. While predicting the outcome is a great concept, it hardly accounts for emotional impact of negative results on the patients. It is easier for a patient to be convinced of the negative result once they have tried all possible options and move on than go through the financial and emotional drain. With advancements in science and the field of fertility, there are various tests and preliminary treatments that can be performed before a patient chooses to go through fertility treatment. Bloom is not just an App but also a companion all through their journey in the treatment process. It will be designed to provide patients with a holistic view of: • Where they are currently? • What tests needs to be done prior to starting the treatment process? • What preliminary and supplemental treatment they could take before starting the treatment? • What changes do they need to adopt in their lifestyle? • How the preliminary treatment or changes in lifestyle would benefit them? By what % does it increase the success ratio of the treatment process? • Access to peer support groups going through similar treatment process • Access to medical experts who will be available on-call (premium service) 2.3.0.1 Data Collection: The goal is to design an App which will collect extensive data from users, not limited to : Genetics, Age, Race, Ethnic origin, Demographic information (where they were born, where they grew up, where they live now: this is a key piece of information which will help determine external factors such as climate, environment they may have been exposed to), occupation (which could present as one of the factors for physical and emotional stress). Besides the extensive blood work which tests a patient more for hormone imbalances, the discovery process will include genetic blood tests that may reveal Mutation of Genes (eg. MTHFR). Various parameters will be taken into consideration to understand the patient and their partner’s medical history, family history and fed into the app. The system will then check to see if it has all the values required to feed the data to the next step. For any missing values, a custom test order will be generated to obtain further information. 2.3.0.2 Discovery: Once all values have been fed into the app, it will compare this data against patients with similar ethnicity, age group and their outcome to provide a preliminary report on the success rates with past data. A neural network of fertility centers across the country will help increase the data sample size. The system will start an auto-elimination process based on Machine Language Technique to compare various reasons that has caused infertility in the male or female. 2.3.0.3 Prediction: The program will use data captured from the patient and compare it with available data from the Neural Network of World Wide Fertility Centers (NNWWFC) to build predictive models for outcome of various fertility treatments. AI bot will continue to analyze and perfect the predictive model as it continues to collect data (consent will be acquired) from Patients. 2.3.0.4 Prescription: Based on all computations, patients will be presented with a holistic picture on the possible conditions that may have caused infertility, procedure options and the success rate with each, a list of preliminary treatment options, alternative therapies and life style changes before undertaking the actual procedure. The app will give the best possible options for patients including data to support success rates or in some cases prepare them for the outcome which may not be favorable. While the field of medicine captures data pertaining to science behind the reasons of infertility in men or women, my app will have the ability to build models which includes non-medical data to identify few causes for infertility. Given the sensitive nature of information, the app will be compliant to HIPAA rules and to protect privacy of patient, it will incorporate multi-factor authentication. 2.4 Next steps Besides being a software companion to the patients, Bloom can also help with comprehensive data to help make case with Insurance companies on behalf of the patients. Insurance companies hardly cover such fertility treatments but those which do cover, expect the patients complete few cycles of IUI before authorizing IVF. Bloom can provide data to insurance companies with complete profile on what the success rates are and why there should be an exception made in the patient’s case. The same data can also help selfpay patients to choose or skip few preliminary treatments before signing up for IVF. The tool will continue to collect data from patients who are undergoing treatments to keep perfecting its model for suggestive / customized treatments. Over a period of time, the tool can provide closest to accurate results in outcome of fertility treatment, retention of pregnancy and a healthy baby. "],
